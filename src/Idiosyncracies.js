		<h1>Idiosyncracies</h1>

		<h3>Social media inactivity</h3>
		<p>
			As of April 12, 2019, I don't use social media{" "}
			<Paren>except for texting</Paren>{" "}
			<Paren>
				enforced by a hard DNS redirect on my laptop and the removal of all
				related apps and web browsers on mobile devices
			</Paren>
			. I have vowed never to work for any company that relies on a product with
			an infinite-scrolling mechanic; I firmly believe that our society's top
			talent should be focused on more important things than getting billions of
			people hopelessly addicted to corporate profit machines.
		</p>

		<h3>Rapid hydration</h3>
		<p>
			I can drink a full 1 liter water bottle{" "}
			<Paren>wide mouthed and either glass, metal, or hard plastic</Paren> in 47
			seconds. I cannot, however, due this multiple times in a row, for
			painfully biological reasons. I have no idea if this is actually that
			fast, but it feels impressive and looks great on my résumé either way!
		</p>

		<h3>Rapid consumption</h3>
		<p>
			As with water, I can eat at an alarming speed{" "}
			<Paren>although I have no specific metric</Paren>. It's not uncommon for
			me to finish my meals 30-80% before any companions. This is most likely
			caused by the existence of this same big mouth that inspires me to
			routinely broadcast my myriad opinions into the beckoning void.
		</p>

		<h3>Constantly asking people about insects</h3>
		<p>
			When a conversation with a new acquaintence lulls, my go-to response is to
			ask them what their favorite insect is. People's reactions are legion, and
			never fail to amuse me! Most people prefer either the{" "}
			<a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly"
				target="_blank"
				rel="noopener noreferrer"
			>
				butterfly
			</a>
			,{" "}
			<a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonfly"
				target="_blank"
				rel="noopener noreferrer"
			>
				dragonfly
			</a>
			, or{" "}
			<a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladybug"
				target="_blank"
				rel="noopener noreferrer"
			>
				ladybug
			</a>
			, curiously.
		</p>
		<p>
			What <em>is</em> your favorite insect, by the way? Do{" "}
			<EmailLink>email me</EmailLink> your opinion, please, along with an
			explanation of what you're procrastinating on right now so badly as to
			actually do that!
		</p>

		<h3>Chronic smartphone avoidance</h3>
		<p>
			When my phone isn't out of battery, it's probably in my backpack. Why? I
			don't like being chained to anything when I can help it. Not having to
			worry about notifications impeding on my consciousness has taken a big
			weight off my shoulders; do try it sometime!
		</p>

		<h3>Not knowing anything about current politics</h3>
		<p>
			Why spend my headspace and emotional energy being angry over things that I
			cannot affect, and that do not affect me? This mutual irrelevance between
			myself and our modern two-sided propoganda game has inspired me to stop
			spending my time and memory and emotions on it; I don't have enough time
			in this life to impact many things, even <em>without</em> it!
