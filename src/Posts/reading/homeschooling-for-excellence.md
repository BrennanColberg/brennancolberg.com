The opening of this book is a most fantastic description and argument of why homeschooling is better than the alternative. I could hardly choose which parts to transcribe; most all of it is great.

Past that, this book is not well written or very poignant. It merely describes one family's experience in homeschooling, and gives advice to fellow families in the late 20th century as to resources that proved useful and could be helpful for others. It's certainly not a very interesting or inherently pleasurable read.

I found it most useful as a reassurance that students can, indeed, do well when homeschooled and largely self-directed. Already knowing this from my own childhood and self-education, however, it proved not too useful. Its resource recommendations are also quite out-dated for the modern Internet-connected world... that said, it shoes what things can easily be translated and made more specifically accessible through the Internet's vast array of resources.

At least the read was short! The Colfaxes kept it from droning unnecessarily, for sure. I can see how this would have been a breakout work when it was first published—wow, homeschooling, so novel!—but it is far outclassed by Holt and Llewellyn today. They analyze and give a theoretical foundation for a different model, while this gives one example and tentative recommendations for the 1990s world based on their data point; the former's value is obviously much better preserved. This book is a work of its time; to people who had never even considered homeschooling—let alone for IMPROVED performance—this must certainly have been a bombshell.

Would recommend reading in 1990. Would not recommend today. In the modern world, Llewellyn's handbook is better in almost every way.
