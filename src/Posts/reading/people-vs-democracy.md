This book is interesting and very mind-opening. The central insight—a distinction between "illiberal democracy" and "undemocratic liberalism" (as contrasted with the liberal democracy that underpins the Western system)—is one of those that makes you go "Wow! Everything makes a lot more sense now!" And indeed it does.

Mounk's writing, I've found as I copy much of it down, uses too many words. Every time I want to capture an idea, I have to copy the whole paragraph; in other books, it's generally express in a sentence or two. Many good ideas are also repeated multiple times throughout the book in varying levels of detail; I did not realize this until finding many instances of flagging the same idea twice. This book could likely be much shorter and more compact; it reads well, though.
