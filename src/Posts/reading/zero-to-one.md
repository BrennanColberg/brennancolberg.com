Perhaps one of the most important things in this remarkable book is Thiel's classification of human models of the future. He describes thinking around two axes: one optimistic/pessimistic (straightforward, better vs worse) and one definite/indefinite (whether a path is envisioned, or just a nebulous feeling). This model is remarkably poignant in how it describes outlooks: those who are optimistic and definite see a better future and a path to get there, so they're more likely to go out and change things. This kind of vision is how the US got where it is; it's what powers most entrepreneurial titans, specifically Musk. Indefinite optimism is what America is experiencing today, Thiel argues: we're sure it'll be better, but nobody does anything to make it so... rather, we hedge bets and ride whims and feelings. Nothing gets done! Pessimism is at hold in Europe and China; indefinite in the former, definite in the latter. It's an interesting model. I'm a definite optimist; I see paths, specifically in education, and I'd like to follow them.

Thiel also emphasizes the importance of contrarian thought: "What belief do you hold that almost nobody else does?" he asks his interviewees, hoping to ascertain some glimpse of insight or vision. Me? I think that a technologically savvy private school system can provide near-universal access to top-of-the-line pre-collegiate education for nearly all US economic classes in the moderate-term future.
