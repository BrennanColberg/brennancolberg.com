This “perfect” American novel is quite confusing to me. Maybe it was because I just breezed through it? Maybe it’s more of a cultural relic and was actually relevant back in the 1950s? I’m not sure.

It’s supposedly the novel about teenage angst, as I understand it: it’s about a guy who flunks out of his boarding school and spends time hiding in NYC thinking about sex and alcohol and the nature of life itself. Sounds cliche, and yeah, it’s pretty cliche—from my perspective.

Mom and I talked about it in the car the other day before I had finished it, and her perspective is that it was very rebellious and taboo when written—back then, you simply don’t put these kinds of things into writing, right? It makes more sense to me, then—if that’s the case—how this is so significant.

The way Salinger portrayed the lack of awareness or thought of consent in sexual relationships was quite alarming to my proper 2019 mind… according to Holden (the protagonist), girls would say “stop” and be dismissed/ignored, essentially. He saw himself as weak for actually stopping—how times have changed for the better!
