Interesting book; definitely more invigorating than "The Case Against Standardized Testing." Been reading it mainly on buses to and from UW, a first for me!

I like particularly Kohn's method of breaking down the idea of homework in virtually every conceivable logical fashion; he analyzes its effectiveness, its alleged benefits, the arguments of those in favor of it... almost all time so far (the first third of the book) has been focused on pro-homework arguments in detail before he even offers any original argument against it. It's very thorough and meticulous setup; I appreciate it very much. Super intriguing, too! In my future school I'll certainly abstain from giving any elementary-level homework, and also do the same for higher levels as much as possible.

Been reading more recently; however, Kohn's writing is admittedly dull. His arguments are certainly thorough, but in that completeness it loses almost all power of engagement; I need to read some fiction, I think, in order to balance out what has become a form of subtle drudgery. Don't get me wrong, though, it's still fascinating! It's just that he emphasizes a point in about seven different ways before moving on; extremely bulletproof argumentation, but not very engaging or inspiring once you comprehend the main point. Academic writing, in other words, really.
