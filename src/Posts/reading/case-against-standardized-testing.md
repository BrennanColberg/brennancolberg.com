The Case Against Standardized Testing (Alfie Kohn)

This book was incredibly dull; although there are good points, they're so diluted and repetitive that this book could have probably been summed up in a single journal article's length. Seems like an author just trying to push a book out; probably was.

Interesting points to be had, as I said, for sure! Kohn has a very interesting perspective that standardized tests should be completely eliminated, or that this should at least serve as a goal. If they continue to exist, he says there should be a few criteria that we seek to meet as often as possible:

- no multiple choice tests (shows no thought, prone to guessability)
- no norm-referenced tests; rather, standards-based tests (don't make it a horse race; instead, judge kids independently against knowledge of material)
- no yearly tests (fatigue, pointlessness)
- no young-age tests (abysmally suited for the young learner's brain)
- cram test prep (prep for 3 weeks at end of year after doing own thing, e.g. Weirusz)

That's really about it... it goes over these points ad nauseam without adding too much of significance. Some examples, mostly filler. Very boring! However, good to get that detailed perspective on tests; it's an interesting one, for sure, if ambitious. As it was published in 2000, I'd be curious to see how No Child Left Behind factored into those ideas; ultimately, what Kohn thinks of that drive in general.
