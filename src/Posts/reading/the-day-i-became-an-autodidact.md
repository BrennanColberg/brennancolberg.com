This book is a wonderful first-hand recollection / autobiography (?) by Kendall Hailey, a woman who was born into a literary family and grew up in Los Angeles. She details the process of her maturation from late high school through her first success as an actress, where she chooses to graduate early to self-educate, read, write, and act.

It's an interesting book; no masterpiece, but gives an interesting perspective on life. More than anything else, it displays a first-person point of view from a bibliophile ravenously exploring everything she can and wants to read; her passion is eminent, and this is perhaps one of the guiding themes of this patching of autobiographical journal-esque writings.

I liked it, overall. Not too stodgy, not fluid fiction, just the writings of a passionate young woman exploring life and desire and the world. I'm glad I read it.
