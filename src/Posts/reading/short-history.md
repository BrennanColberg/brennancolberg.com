This was a fantastic read; I'd recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone interested in just about anything (science-related, that is). Bryson fantastically intertwines an engaging telling of history—that _of_ science—with what we know of life, the universe, and everything—_from_ the process of science. From physics to botany to geology to biology, it's amazing how engaging Bryson makes just about every branch of science routinely used in classrooms to put poor students to sleep. He strips away layers of pretentiousness, showing exactly what a messy and engaging process it's been to discover and refine ideas over the centuries. Somehow, he manages to avoid exalting scientists—imperfect and often quirky humans, like any of us—while being stricken with awe for the universe as we understand it.

There's not much else to say; so many fields and interesting tidbits are blitzed through in this book that any attempt to summarize it would fall flat on its face. All I'll write is this: if you're curious about the world, want to be, used to be, or know someone who is—pick up this book. You won't want to put it down.
