			My name is Brennan Colberg.{" "}
			<span className="no-bold">I'm an autodidact, among other things.</span>
		</h1>
		<p>
			Here you'll find a list of <Link to="/reading">the books I've read</Link>{" "}
			<Paren>and what I think of at least some of them</Paren>, all kinds of{" "}
			<Link to="/writing">writings on various topics</Link>, and anything else I
			deem fitting to post.
		</p>
		<p>
			It's not a pretty site, that's for sureâ€”I've tried to keep it bare-bones
			utilitarian, meant for reading and not for thrill. Someday, if I find time
			to change it{" "}
			<Paren>and push away indecisiveness long enough to finish the task</Paren>
			, I will! Graphic design and CSS, unfortunately, are not talents with
			which I've been graced. It took a whopping twenty minutes to simply choose
			the <em>link</em> color to use on this website; more choice than that
			often results in temporary paralysis{" "}
			<Paren>and mediocre results, to boot</Paren>.

				Messenger
