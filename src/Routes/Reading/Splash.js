		<h1>My Reading</h1>
		<p>
			I read a lot. Since June 2018, I've finished {uniqueBooks.length}{" "}
			different booksâ€“from novels to political analyses, history to educational
			theory, classics to self-help books, I tend to pick up anything that
			piques my interest. All {bookFinishes.length} reads{" "}
			<Paren>
				including some re-reads, notably Asimov's <em>Foundation</em> series
			</Paren>{" "}
			are listed below, in chronological order by finishing date{" "}
			<Paren>most recent first</Paren>.
		</p>
		<p>
			I've given each book a personal rating, shown by color: the greener a book
			is, the more I'd recommend it; the redder, the less.{" "}
			<Paren>
				Obviously, these are all purely my opinion, which often diverges from
				the norm; for instance, most people seem to love Gaiman's{" "}
				<em>American Gods</em>, while I could barely get through it.
			</Paren>{" "}
			<Paren>
				Recommending a book doesn't necessarily mean that I agree with
				everything it says; I just think that you should read it.
			</Paren>{" "}
			I've also written thoughts about and/or transcribed quotes from certain
			books; those ones have a shadow. Click on each to read more.
		</p>
		<div className="books">
			{bookFinishes
				// descending chronological order of most recent read
				.sort((a, b) =>
					a.finish.date !== b.finish.date
						? a.finish.date < b.finish.date
						: a.finish.order < b.finish.order
				)
				.map((book, i) => (
					<Book key={i} book={book} />
				))}
		</div>

			If you're interested in chatting about any of these books{" "}
			<Paren>
				whether from personal curiosity, wanting to hear my take on them, or
				just wanting to talk in more depth
