	<strong>Hello, my name is Brennan!</strong> Welcome to my website; this is the second website I've made (the first one was for <a href="https://frc3268.github.io" target="_blank">my robotics team</a>). I'm a first-year Computer Science student at the University of Washington in Seattle. I program a lot in my spare time -- look at the projects down below! I want to start posting blogs as well, soon -- look at the placeholder blog area down below too!
