Being in a top school, moreover, I felt shocked that <em>this</em> was all we humans had come up with so far. From there, I started reading, writing, and thinking deeply about what needs to be done.</p><h4>What makes you interested in computer science?</h4><p>I love systems, abstractions, and the way they interact. Additionally, there's something enchanting about the ability to individually make something that can impact the world with merely your mind and fingers. Data visualization is an especially amazing part of that, in my opinion!</p><p>In the coming years, much of the world's power will become centralized around those who can weild technology effectively. It's fun, albeit frightening, to be on top of this transformation and watch it from within.</p><h4>How much <em>do</em> you read?</h4><p>I read and manually copy ~5-8 pages worth of key excerpts from each of approximately 10 books per month (120 per year).</p><h4>What's your life plan?</h4><p>I am figuring out how to create a centralized school system separate from the public/governmental one, which can rapidly iterate by scientifically testing theories and methods to optimize for student satisfaction and growth <em>(<strong>not</strong> standardized test scores)</em>.</p><p>Most educational innovation that I see from the tech world consists in attempts to completetly replace physical schools with online software; I do not believe this to be the correct course. School redesigns, in my view, should revolve around first redefining the roles of teachers and students in the classroom, and then seeing how technology can aid that transformation (as opposed to creating technology and shoehorning it in whether helpful or not).</p><h4>How old are you?</h4><p>Around 20.</p><h4>Where are you?</h4><p>I live in Seattle, WA, USA.</p></div></div></article><article id="idiosyncracies" class="panel secondary"><div class="image"><img src="images/water-drip.jpg" alt="" data-position="center center"/></div><div class="content"><ul class="actions animated spinX"><li><a href="#" class="button small back">Back</a></li></ul><div class="inner"><header><h2>"Idiosyncracies"</h2></header><h4>Social media inactivity</h4><p>As of April 12, 2019, I don't use social media (except for texting) (enforced by a hard DNS redirect on my laptop and the removal of all related apps and web browsers on mobile devices). I have vowed never to work for any company that relies on a product with an infinite-scrolling mechanic; I firmly believe that our society's top talent should be focused on more important things than getting billions of people hopelessly addicted to corporate profit machines.</p><h4>Rapid hydration</h4><p>I can drink a full 1 liter water bottle (wide mouthed and either glass, metal, or hard plastic) in 47 seconds. I cannot, however, due this multiple times in a row, for painfully biological reasons. I have no idea if this is actually that fast, but it feels impressive and looks great on my résumé either way!</p><h4>Rapid consumption</h4><p>As with water, I can eat at an alarming speed (although I have no specific metric). It's not uncommon for me to finish my meals 30-80% before any companions. This is most likely caused by the existence of this same big mouth that inspires me to routinely broadcast my myriad opinions into the beckoning void.</p><h4>Constantly asking people about insects</h4><p>When a conversation with a new acquaintence lulls, my go-to response is to ask them what their favorite insect is. People's reactions are legion, and never fail to amuse me! Most people prefer either the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly" target="_blank">butterfly</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonfly" target="_blank">dragonfly</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladybug" target="_blank">ladybug</a>, curiously.</p><p>What <em>is</em> your favorite insect, by the way? Do <a href="mailto:brennan.colberg@gmail.com">email me</a> your thoughts, please, along with an explanation of what you're procrastinating on right now!</p><h4>Chronic smartphone avoidance</h4><p>When my phone isn't out of battery, it's probably in my backpack. Why? I don't like being chained to anything when I can help it. Not having to worry about notifications impeding on my consciousness has taken a big weight off my shoulders; do try it sometime!</p><h4>Not knowing anything about current politics</h4><p>Why spend my headspace and emotional energy being angry over things that I cannot affect, and that do not affect me? This mutual irrelevance between myself and our modern two-sided propoganda game has inspired me to stop spending my time and memory and emotions on it; I don't have enough time in this life to impact many things, even <em>without</em> it!</p></div></div></article><footer id="footer"><p class="copyright">&copy; Brennan D.
