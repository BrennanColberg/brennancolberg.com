# Welcome to my website!

I'm an autodidact (learn from [books](/books) as a primary hobby), programmer (like to make things), and miser (don't like to spend money).

I'm also procrastinating on putting more proper content on this website! ðŸ˜Š

Right now, I'm building [WEEKDAYS](https://joinweekdays.com), a marketplace for elementary-age micro-schools (each has 3-8 kids, with 1 teacher, in 1 home).

I live in Corvallis, OR (but am extremely connected to Seattle).
